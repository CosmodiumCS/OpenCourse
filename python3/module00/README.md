 # Module 0.0.0 -  Installation & Setup
- how to install or use python

## 0.0.1 - Online Option
- if you don't want to install Python onto your computer, there are plenty of online options that you can choose
- the one I recommend most is Replit 'https://replit.com/~'
	- fun fact, REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print and Loop
	- so REPL it is saying Read Evaluate Print and Loop it
---
- make an account
- to make a python prject, hit the `+ New Repl` button on the top left
- choose `Python`
- I suggest navigating to `My repls` 
- click the `+ New folder` button
- name the folder `introductionToPython3` [or something along those lines]
- here you can store your projects and practices form this course

## 0.0.2 - Installing Python3 on Windows 10 & MacOS
- navigate to 'https://www.python.org/downloads/'
- click the download button and run the file
- follow the instructions shown on the wizard 

## 0.0.3 - Installing Python3 on Linux
- open a terminal and run:
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

## 0.0.4 - Writing Python3 Code
python can be written in two diffent enviorments

1. Python Shell
- a python module runs each line of syntax after it is written
- good for tutorials, testing, and light programming
- can be opened by running the following in a powershell, command line, or terminal 
```
python3
```
> Note: Windows has an app for the Python3 Module [if installed via the 0.0.2 instructions]

2. IDE or Text Editor
- an IDE [Integrated Developer Enviorment] or Text Editor is a peice of software used to write, run, and often debug code
- in this course we will ue the `Python IDLE` application that came with our Python installation
- if you didn't get the IDLE application, you can use your default text editor or install Atom: 'https://atom.io/'
- default text editors
```
Windows: Notepad
MacOS: TextEdit
Linux: Text Editor
```

## 0.0.5 - Running Python
- Python files use the extension `.py`
- to run them, we can either use an IDE/Text Editor that has running features enabled
- or we can open our respective command line [in the directory of the file] and run
```
python3 FILENAME.py
```
'FILENAME' represents the name of the file
